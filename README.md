# Credman

Handy console tool for developers to manage Rails credentials.

## Motivation

Rails credentials is a nice tool to store encrypted credentials directly in your repo. Starts from rails 6.0 it brings multi environment credentials feature that allow us to split credentials into separate files.

But it also brought a lot of pain for developers:
- each enviroment credentials file must have a complete list of all keys. It's easy to forget to add a key into one of the environments (see [set](#credman-set) and [delete](#credman-delete) command)
- You have to add/edit keys manually open each environment file. It's ok for one file but not for 3 or more. It also can brings errors you might miss until deploy to production. (see [set](#credman-set) and [delete](#credman-delete) command)
- merge conflicts in creds files become a hell since files are encrypted (see [conflicts](#credman-conflicts) command)
- you can't easily to see what keys was added/changed/deleted in the current branch (see [diff](#credman-diff) command)

This gem is designed to solve all these problems and make life easier for developers who use multi environment credentials.

### credman conflicts

Run it if you have merge conflicts in `configs/credentials/*.yml.enc`.
That interactive tool will help you resolve the conflict.
In most of cases it will just automagically resolve the conflicts.
In case of a key was changed in both branches it will ask you to choose the correct value.

```
bundle exec credman conflicts
```

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

```
development:
        ❗️ The key another_key changed in both branches, their: "another_value", our: "conflicting_value"
Which one should we use? Please type `their` or `our` to apply particular change or enter to abort.
> their
✅ another_key set as "another_value"
✅ Merged config for rspec has been saved
          resolves conflict with user input
```
